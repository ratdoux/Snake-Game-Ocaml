# Snake-Game-Ocaml

CPinter_sn.ml and CPutil_sn.ml are basic extensions needed for the snake game to function which were not coded by me.

The main logic is in snake.ml, currently working on a version with a bit more functionality in snake2.ml, so that's why it's so messy.

!snake2.ml needs snake.ml to function!
